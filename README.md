# FoodTracker_iOS_App

This repository contains code for the FoodTracker iOS app tutorial.  FoodTracker is an app that lets users list their recent meals.  Users can include an image and a rating in their meal listing.  Further, the app enables users to add new meals and delete/edit existing ones.

The  key differences between my app and the tutorial  are 
(i) Summary comments at the beginning of most key files in project
(ii) The  default sample images are my own

Build Instructions:
(i) Open FoodTracker.xcodeproj
(ii) Run Simulation
